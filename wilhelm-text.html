These unbroken lines stand for the primal power, which is light-giving, active, strong, and of the spirit. The hexagram is consistently strong in character, and since it is without weakness, its essence is power or energy. Its image is  heaven. Its energy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed conditions in space and is therefore conceived of as motion. Time is regarded as the basis of this motion. Thus the hexagram includes also the power of time and  the power of persisting in time, that is, duration. The power represented by the hexagram is to be interpreted in a dual sense in terms of its action on the universe and of its action on the world of men. In relation to the universe, the hexagram expresses the strong, creative action of the Deity.In relation to the human world, it denotes the creative action of the holy man or sage, of the ruler or leader of men, who through his power awakens and develops their higher nature.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">THE JUDGMENT</h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    THE CREATIVE works sublime success,<br/>                    Furthering through perseverance.                </p>                <p data-book="jc">                      According to the original meaning, the attributes [sublimity, potentiality                    of success, power to further, perseverance] are paired. When an individual                    draws this oracle, it means that success will come to him from the primal                    depths of the universe and that everything depends upon his seeking his                    happiness and that of others in one way only, that is, by perseverance                    in what is right. The specific meanings of the four attributes became                    the subject of speculation at an early date. The Chinese word here rendered                    by "sublime" means literally "head", "origin", "great". This is why Confucius                    says in explaining it: "Great indeed is the generating power of the Creative;                    all beings owe their beginning to it. This power permeates all heaven."                    For this attribute inheres in the other three as well. The beginning of                    all things lies still in the beyond in the form of ideas that have yet to                    become real. But the Creative furthermore has power to lend form to these                    archetypes of ideas. This is indicated in the word success, and the process                    is represented by an image from nature: "The clouds pass and the rain does                    its work, and all individual beings flow into their forms." Applies to                    the human world, these attributes show the great man the way to notable                    success: "Because he sees with great clarity and cause and effects, he completes                    the six steps at the right time and mounts  toward heaven on them at the                    right time, as though on six dragons." The six  steps are the six different                    positions given in the hexagram, which are represented later by the dragon                    symbol. Here it is shown that the way to success lies in apprehending and                    giving actuality to the way of the universe [Tao], which, as a law running                    through end and beginning, brings about all phenomena in time. Thus each                    step attained forthwith becomes a preparation for the next. Time is no longer                    a hindrance but the means of making actual what is potential. The act of                    creation having found expression in the two attributes sublimity and success,                    the work of conservation is shown to be a continuous actualization and differentiation                    of form. This is expressed in the two terms "furthering" (literally, "creating                    that which accords with the nature of a given being")  and "persevering"                    (literally, "correct and firm"). "The course of the Creative  alters and                    shapes beings until each attains its true, specific nature, then  it keeps                    them in conformity with the Great Harmony. Thus does it show itself to further                    through perseverance." In relation to the human sphere, this shows how the                    great man brings peace and security to the world through his activity in                    creating order: "He towers high above the multitude of beings, and all lands                    are united in peace." Another line of speculation goes still further in                    separating the words "sublime," "success," "furthering," "perseverance,"                    and parallels them with the four cardinal virtues in humanity. To sublimity,                    which, as the fundamental principle, embraces all the other attributes,                    it  links love. To the attribute success are linked the morals, which regulate                    and organize expressions of love and thereby make them successful. The attribute                    furthering is correlated with justice, which creates the conditions in which                    each receives that which accords with his being, that which is due him and                    which constitutes his happiness. The attribute perseverance is correlated                    with wisdom, which discerns the immutable laws of all that happens and can                    therefore bring about enduring conditions. These speculations, already broached                    in the commentary called W&ecirc;n Yen, later formed the bridge connecting                    the philosophy of the "five stages (elements) of change," as laid down in                    the Book of History (Shu Ching) with the philosophy of the Book of Changes,                    which is based solely on the polarity of positive and negative principles.                    In the course of time this combination of the two systems of thought opened                    the way for an increasingly intricate number symbolism.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">THE IMAGE</h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    The movement of heaven is full of power. <br>                    Thus the superior man makes himself strong and <br>                    untiring.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    Since there is only one heaven, the doubling of the trigram Ch'ien,                    of which heaven is the image, indicates the movement of heaven. One complete                    revolution of heaven makes a day, and the repetition of the trigram means                    that each day is followed by another. This creates the idea of time.                    Since it is the same heaven moving with untiring power, there is also                    created the idea of duration both in and beyond time, a movement that                    never stops nor slackens, just as one day follows another in an unending                    course. This duration in time is the image of the power inherent in the                    Creative. With this image as a model, the sage learns how best to develop                    himself so that his influence may endure. He must make himself strong in                    every way, by consciously casting out all that is inferior and degrading.                    Thus he attains that tirelessness which depends upon consciously limiting                    the fields of his activity.                </p>                <!--LINES-->                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">THE LINES</h4>                <div data-line="1.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Hidden dragon.

The dragon is a symbol of the electrically charged,                        dynamic, arousing force that manifests itself in the thunderstorm. In                        winter this energy withdraws into the earth; in the early summer it becomes                        active again, appearing in the sky as thunder and lightning. As a result                        the creative forces on earth begin to stir again. Here this creative                        force is still hidden beneath the earth and therefore has no effect. In                        terms of human affairs, this symbolizes a great man who is still unrecognized.                        Nonetheless he remains true to himself. He does not allow himself to be                        influenced by outward success or failure, but confident in his strength,                        he bides his time.

The strength of the Creative and the mildness of the Receptive                        unite.

The broken lines represents the dark, yielding, receptive primal power of yin. The attribute of the hexagram is devotion; its image is the earth. It is the perfect complement of THE CREATIVE--the complement, not the opposite, for the Receptive does not combat the Creative but completes it . It represents nature in contrast to spirit, earth in contrast to heaven, space as against time, the female-maternal as against the male-paternal. However, as applied to human affairs, the principle of this complementary relationship is found not only in the relation between man and woman, but also in that between prince and minister and between father and son. Indeed, even in the individual this duality appears in the coexistence of the spiritual world and the world of the senses. But strictly speaking there is no real dualism here, because there is a clearly defined hierarchic relationship between the two principles. In itself of course the Receptive is just as important as the Creative, but the attribute of devotion defines the place occupied by this primal power in relation to the Creative. For the Receptive must be activated and led by the Creative; then it is productive of good. Only when it abandons this position and tries to stand as an equal side by side with the Creative, does it become evil. The result then is opposition to and struggle against the Creative, which is productive of evil to both.</p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT</h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    THE RECEPTIVE brings about sublime success,<br>                    Furthering through the perseverance of a mare.<br>                    If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead,<br>                    He goes astray;<br>                    But if he follows, he finds guidance.<br>                    It is favorable to find friends in the west and south,<br>                    To forego friends in the east and north.<br>                    Quiet perseverance brings good fortune.</p>                <p data-book="jc">                      The four fundamental aspects of the Creative--"sublime success, furthering through perseverance"--are also attributed to the Receptive. Here, however, the perseverance is more closely defined: it is that of a mare. The Receptive connotes spatial reality in contrast to the spiritual potentiality of the Creative. The potential becomes real and the spiritual becomes spatial through a specifically qualifying definition. Thus the qualification, "of a mare," is here added to the idea of perseverance. The horse belongs to earth just as the dragon belongs to heaven. Its tireless roaming over the plains is taken as a symbol of the vast expanse of the earth. This is the symbol chosen because the mare combines the strength and swiftness of the horse with the gentleness and devotion of the cow. Only because nature in its myriad forms corresponds with the myriad impulses of the Creative can it make these impulses real. Nature's richness lies in its power to nourish all living things; its greatness lies in its power to give then beauty and splendor. Thus it prospers all that lives. IT is the Creative that begets things, but they are brought to birth by the Receptive. Applied to human affairs, therefore, what the hexagram indicated is action in conformity with the situation. The person in questions not in an independent position, but is acting as an assistant. This means that he must achieve something. It is not his task to try to lead--that would only make him lose the way-but to let himself be led. If he knows how to meet fate with an attitude of acceptance, he is sure to find the right guidance. The superior man lets himself be guided; he does not go ahead blindly, but learns from the situation what is demanded of him and then follows this intimation from fate. Since there is something to be accomplished, we need friends and helpers in the hour of toil and effort, once the ideas to be realized are firmly set. The time of toil and effort is indicated by the west and south, for west and south symbolize the place where the Receptive works for the Creative, as nature does in summer and autumn. If in that situation one does not mobilize all one's powers, the work to be accomplished will not be done. Hence to find friends there means to find guidance. But in addition to the time of toil and effort, there is also a time of planning, and for this we need this solitude. The east symbolized the place where a man receives orders from his master, and the north the place where he reports on what he has done. At that time he must be alone and objective. In this sacred hour he must do without companions. So that the purity of the moment may not be spoiled by fictional hates and favoritism.</p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE</h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    The earth's condition is receptive devotion.<br>                    Thus the superior man who has breadth of character<br>                    Carries the outer world.</p>                <p data-book="ic">                    Just as there is only one heaven, so too there is only one earth. In the hexagram of heaven the doubling of the trigram implies duration in time, but in the hexagram of earth the doubling connotes the solidity and extension in space by virtue of which the earth is able to carry and preserve all things that live and move upon it. The earth in its devotion carries all things, good and evil,, without exception. In the same way the superior man gives to his character breadth, purity, and sustaining power, so that he is able both to support and to bear with people and things.</p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES</h4>                <div data-line="2.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six at the beginning means:</p>                    <p class="line-text">                        When there is hoarfrost underfoot,<br>                        Solid ice is not far off.</p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        Just as the light-giving power represents life, so the dark power, the shadowy, represents death.

After these first warnings, signs of death will gradually multiply, until, in obedience to immutable laws, stark winter with its ice is here. In life it is the same. After certain scarcely noticeable signs of decay have appeared, they go on increasing until final dissolution comes. But in life precautions can be taken by heeding the first signs of decay and checking them in time.</p>                </div>                <div data-line="2.2" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six in the second place means:</p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Straight, square, great.<br>                        Without purpose,<br>                        Yet nothing remains unfurthered.</p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        The symbol of heaven is the circle, and that of earth is the square. Thus squareness is a primary quality of the earth. On the other hand, movement in a straight line, as well as magnitude, is a primary quality of the Creative. But all square things have their origin in a straight line and into turn form solid bodies. In mathematics, when we discriminate between lines, planes and solids, we find that rectangular planes result from straight lines, and cubic magnitudes from rectangular planes. The Receptive accommodates itself to the qualities of the Creative and makes them its own. Thus a square develops out of a straight line and a cube out of a square. This is compliance with the laws of the Creative; nothing is taken away, nothing added. Therefore the Receptive has no need of a special purpose of its own, nor of any effort' yet everything turns out as it should. Nature creates all beings without erring: this is its foursquareness. It tolerates all creatures equally: this is its greatness. Therefore it attains what is right for all without artifice or special intentions. Man achieves the height of wisdom when all that he does is as self-evident as what nature does.</p>                </div>                <div data-line="2.3" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six in the third place means:</p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Hidden lines.<br>                        One is able to remain persevering.<br>                        If by chance you are in the service of a king,<br>                        Seek not works, but bring to completion.</p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        If a man is free of vanity he is able to conceal his abilities and keep them from attracting attention too soon; thus he can mature undisturbed.

The hexagram indicates the way in which heaven and earth bring forth individual beings. It is their first meeting, which is beset with difficulties. The lower trigram Chên is the Arousing; its motion is upward and its image is thunder. The upper trigram K'an stands for the Abysmal, the dangerous. Its motion is downward and its image is rain. The situation points to teeming, chaotic profusion; thunder and rain fill the air. But the chaos clears up. While the Abysmal sinks, the upward movement eventually passes beyond the danger. A thunderstorm brings release from tension, and all things breathe freely again.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    DIFFICULTY AT THE BEGINNING works supreme success,<br>                    Furthering through perseverance.<br>                    Nothing should be undertaken.<br>                    It furthers one to appoint helpers.                </p>                <p data-book="jc">                      Times of growth are beset with difficulties. They resemble a first birth. But these difficulties arise from the very profusion of all that is struggling to attain form . Everything is in motion: therefore if one perseveres there is a prospect of great success, in spite of the existing danger. When it is a man's fate to undertake such new beginnings, everything is still unformed, dark. Hence he must hold back, because any premature move might bring disaster. Likewise, it is very important not to remain alone; in order to overcome the chaos he needs helpers. This is not to say, however, that he himself should look on passively at what is happening. He must lend his hand and participate with inspiration and guidance.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Clouds and thunder:<br>                    The image of DIFFICULTY AT THE BEGINNING.<br>                    Thus the superior man<br>                    Brings order out of confusion.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    Clouds and thunder are represented by definite decorative lines; this means that in the chaos of difficulty at the beginning, order is already implicit.

In order to find one's place in the infinity of being, one must be able both to separate and to unite.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES                </h4>                <div data-line="3.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Hesitation and hindrance.<br>                        It furthers one to remain persevering.<br>                        It furthers one to appoint helpers.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        If a person encounters a hindrance at the beginning of an enterprise, he must not try to force advance but must pause and take thought.

Gradually it becomes clear that he has no evil intentions but seeks to be friendly and to offer help. But this offer is not to be accepted, because it does not come from the right quarter. We must wait until the time is fulfilled; ten years is a fulfilled cycle of time. Then normal conditions return of themselves, and we can join forces with the friend intended for us. Using the image of a betrothed girl who remains true to her lover in face of grave conflicts, the hexagram gives counsel for a special situation. When in times of difficulty a hindrance is encountered and unexpected relief is offered from a source unrelated to us, we must be careful and not take upon ourselves any obligations entailed by such help; otherwise our freedom of decision is impaired.

The image of the upper trigram, Kên, is the mountain, that of the lower, K'an, is water; the spring rising at the foot of the mountain is the image of inexperienced youth. Keeping still is the attribute of the upper trigram; that of the lower is the abyss, danger. Stopping in perplexity on the brink of a dangerous abyss is a symbol of the folly of youth. However, the two trigrams also show the way of overcoming the follies of youth. Water is something that of necessity flows on. When the spring gushes forth, it does not know at first where it will go. But its steady flow fills up the deep place blocking its progress, and success is attained.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    YOUTHFUL FOLLY has success.<br>                    It is not I who seek the young fool;<br>                    The young fool seeks me.<br>                    At the first oracle I inform him. <br>                    If he asks two or three times, it is importunity.<br>                    If he importunes, I give him no information.<br>                    Perseverance furthers.                </p>                <p data-book="jc">                      In the time of youth, folly is not an evil. One may succeed in spite of it, provided one finds an experienced teacher and has the right attitude toward him. This means, first of all, that the youth himself must be conscious of his lack of experience and must seek out the teacher. Without this modesty and this interest there is no guarantee that he has the necessary receptivity, which should express itself in respectful acceptance of the teacher. This is the reason why the teacher must wait to be sought out instead of offering himself. Only thus can the instruction take place at the right time and in the right way. A teacher's answer to the question of a pupil ought to be clear and definite like that expected from an oracle; thereupon it ought to be accepted as a key for resolution of doubts and a basis for decision. If mistrustful or unintelligent questioning is kept up, it serves only to annoy the teacher. He does well to ignore it in silence, just as the oracle gives one answer only and refuses to be tempted by questions implying doubt. Given addition a perseverance that never slackens until the points are mastered one by one, real success is sure to follow. Thus the hexagram counsels the teacher as well as the pupil.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    A spring wells up at the foot of the mountain:<br>                    The image of YOUTH.<br>                    Thus the superior man fosters his character<br>                    By thoroughness in all that he does.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    A spring succeeds in flowing on and escapes stagnation by filling up all the hollow places in its path.

This hexagram shows the clouds in the heavens, giving rain to refresh all that grows and to provide mankind with food and drink. The rain will come in its own time. We cannot make it come; we have to wait for it. The idea of waiting is further suggested by the attributes of the two trigrams--strength within, danger in from. Strength in the face of danger does not plunge ahead but bides its time, whereas weakness in the face of danger grows agitated and has not the patience to wait.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    WAITING.

This leads to the perseverance that brings good fortune and bestows power to cross the great water. One is faced with a danger that has to be overcome. Weakness and impatience can do nothing. Only a strong man can stand up to his fate, for his inner security enables him to endure to the end. This strength shows itself in uncompromising truthfulness [with himself]. It is only when we have the courage to face things exactly as they are, without any sort of self-deception or illusion, that a light will develop out of events, by which the path to success may be recognized. This recognition must be followed by resolute and persevering action. For only the man who goes to meet his fate resolutely is equipped to deal with it adequately. Then he will be able to cross the great water--that is to say, he will be capable of making the necessary decision and of surmounting the danger.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Clouds rise up to heaven:<br>                    The image of WAITING.<br>                    Thus the superior man eats and drinks,<br>                    Is joyous and of good cheer.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    When clouds rise in the sky, it is a sign that it will rain.

It is enough if the work is done: let the honor go to the other.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="6.4" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine in the fourth place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        One cannot engage in conflict.<br>                        One turns back and submits to fate,<br>                        Changes one's attitude, <br>                        And finds peace in perseverance.<br>                        Good fortune.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        This refers to a person whose inner attitude at first lacks peace.

In the same way military strength is stored up in the mass of the people--invisible in times of peace but always ready for use as a source of power. The attributes of the two trig rams are danger inside and obedience must prevail outside. Of the individual lines, the one that controls the hexagram is the strong nine in the second place, to which the other lines, all yielding, are subordinate. This line indicates a commander, because it stands in the middle of one of the two trigrams. But since it is in the lower rather than the upper trigram, it represents not the ruler but the efficient general, who maintains obedience in the army by his authority.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    THE ARMY.

In order that he may develop his abilities he needs the complete confidence of his ruler, who must entrust him with full responsibility as long as the war lasts. But war is always a dangerous thing and brings with it destruction and devastation. Therefore it should not be resorted to rashly but, like a poisonous drug, should be used as a last recourse.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    In the middle of the earth is water:<br>                    The image of THE ARMY.<br>                    Thus the superior man increases his masses<br>                    By generosity toward the people.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    Ground water is invisibly present within the earth.

He who is generous toward the people wins their love, and a people living under a mild rule becomes strong and powerful. Only a people economically strong can be important in military power. Such power must therefore be cultivated by improving the economic condition of the people and by humane government. Only when there is this invisible bond between government and people, so that the people are sheltered by their government as ground water is sheltered by the earth, is it possible to wage a victorious war.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES                </h4>                <div data-line="7.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        An army must set forth in proper order.<br>                        If the order is not good, misfortune threatens.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        At the beginning of a military enterprise, order is imperative.

At burials and at sacrifices to the dead it was customary in China for the deceased to whom the sacrifice was made to be represented by a boy of the family, who sat in the dead man's place and was honored as his representative. On the basis of this custom the text is interpreted as meaning that a "corpse boy" is sitting in the wagon, or, in other words, that authority is not being exercised by the proper leaders but has been usurped by others. Perhaps the whole difficulty clears up if it is inferred that there has been an error in copying. The character fan, meaning "all," may have been misread as shih, which means "corpse." Allowing for this error, the meaning would be that if the multitude assumes leadership of the army (rides in the wagon), misfortune will ensue.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="7.4" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six in the fourth place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        The army retreats.

Symbolically this connotes holding together and the laws that regulate it. The same idea is suggested by the fact that all the lines of the hexagram except the fifth, the place of the ruler, are yielding. The yielding lines hold together because they are influenced by a man of strong will in the leading position, a man who is their center of union. Moreover, this strong and guiding personality in turn holds together with the others, finding in them the complement of his own nature.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    HOLDING TOGETHER brings good fortune.<br>                    Inquire of the oracle once again<br>                    Whether you possess sublimity, constancy, and perseverance;<br>                    Then there is no blame.<br>                    Those who are uncertain gradually join.<br>                    Whoever come too late<br>                    Meets with misfortune.                </p>                <p data-book="jc">                      What is required is that we unite with others, in order that all may complement and aid one another through holding together. But such holding together calls for a central figure around whom other persons may unite. To become a center of influence holding people together is a grave matter and fraught with great responsibility. It requires greatness of spirit, consistency, and strength. Therefore let him who wishes to gather others about him ask himself whether he is equal to the undertaking, for anyone attempting the task without a real calling for it only makes confusion worse than if no union at all had taken place. But when there is a real rallying point, those who at first are hesitant or uncertain gradually come in of their own accord. Late-comers must suffer the consequences, for in holding together the question of the right time is also important. Relationships are formed and firmly established according to definite inner laws. Common experiences strengthen these ties, and he who comes too late to share in these basic experiences must suffer for it if, as a straggler, he finds the door locked. If a man has recognized the necessity for union and does not feel strong enough to function as the center, it is his duty to become a member of some other organic fellowship.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    On the earth is water:<br>                    The image of HOLDING TOGETHER.<br>                    Thus the kings of antiquity<br>                    Bestowed the different states as fiefs<br>                    And cultivated friendly relations<br>                    With the feudal lords.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    Water fills up all the empty places on the earth and clings fast to it.

Water flows to unite with water, because all parts of it are subject to the same laws. So too should human society hold together through a community of interests that allows each individual to feel himself a member of a whole. The central power of a social organization must see to it that every member finds that his true interest lies in holding together with it, as was the case in the paternal relationship between king and vassals in ancient China.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES                </h4>                <div data-line="8.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Hold to him in truth and loyalty;<br>                        This is without blame.<br>                        Truth, like a full earthen bowl"<br>                        Thus in the end<br>                        Good fortune comes from without.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        Fundamental sincerity is the only proper basis for forming relationships.

If they failed to do this they had to pass through a gate behind which the king stood ready to shoot. Only animals that entered here were shot; those that ran off in front were permitted to escape. This custom accorded with a kingly attitude; the royal hunter did not wish to turn the chase into a slaughter, but held that the kill should consist only of those animals which had so to speak voluntarily exposed themselves. There is depicted here a ruler, or influential man, to whom people are attracted. Those who come to him he accepts, those who do not come are allowed to go their own way. He invited none, flatters none--all come of their own free will. In this way there develops a voluntary dependence among those who hold him. They do not have to be constantly on their guard but may express their opinions openly. Police measures are not necessary, and they cleave to their ruler of their own volition. The same principle of freedom is valid for life in general. We should not woo favor from people. If a man cultivates within himself the purity and the strength that are necessary for one who is the center of a fellowship, those who are meant for him come of their own accord.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="8.6" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six at the top means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        He finds no head for holding together.<br>                        Misfortune.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        The head is the beginning.

The wind restrains the clouds, the rising breath of the Creative, and makes them grow dense, but as yet is not strong enough to turn them to rain. The hexagram presents a configuration of circumstances in which a strong element is temporarily held in leash by a weak element. It is only through gentleness that this can have a successful outcome.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL<br>                    Has success.<br>                    Dense clouds, no rain from our western region.                </p>                <p data-book="jc">                      This image refers to the state of affairs in China at the time when King Wên, who came originally from the west, was in the east at the court of the reigning tyrant Chou Hsin.

Hence the image of many clouds, promising moisture and blessing to the land, although as yet no rain falls. The situation is not unfavorable; there is a prospect of ultimate success, but there are still obstacles in the way, and we can merely take preparatory measures. Only through the small means of friendly persuasion can we exert any influence. The time has not yet come for sweeping measures.

The direction of movement of the two primary trigrams is upward. The fact that the strong treads on the weak is not mentioned in the Book of Changes, because it is taken for granted.

The meaning of the hexagram is not standstill but progress. A man finds himself in an altogether inferior position at the start. However, he has the inner strength that guarantees progress. If he can be content with simplicity, he can make progress without blame. When a man is dissatisfied with modest circumstances, he is restless and ambitious and tries to advance, not for the sake of accomplishing anything worth while, but merely in order to escape from lowliness and poverty by dint of his conduct.

Heaven has placed itself beneath the earth, and so their powers unite in deep harmony. Then peace and blessing descend upon all living things. In the world of man it is a time of social harmony; those in high places show favor to the lowly, and the lowly and inferior is an end to all feuds. In side, at the center, in the key position, is the light principle; the dark principle is outside. Thus the light has a powerful influence, while the dark is submissive. In this way each receives its due. When the good elements of society occupy a central position and are in control, the evil elements come under their influence and change for the better. When the spirit of heaven rules in man, his animal nature also comes under its influence and takes its appropriate place. The individual lines enter the hexagram from below and leave it again at the top. Here the small, weak, and evil elements are about to take their departure, while the great, strong, and good elements are moving up. This brings good fortune and success.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Heaven and earth unite: the image of PEACE.<br>                    Thus the ruler<br>                    Divides and completes the course of heaven and earth,<br>                    And so aids the people.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    Heaven and earth are in contact and combine their influences, producing a time of universal flowering and prosperity.

Thus men divide the uniform flow of time into the seasons, according to the succession of natural phenomena, and mark off infinite space by the points of the compass. In this way nature in its overwhelming profusion of phenomena is bounded and controlled. One the other hand, nature must be furthered in her productiveness. This is done by adjusting the products to the right time and the right place, which increases the natural yield. This controlling and furthering activity of man in his relation to nature is the work on nature that rewards him.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES                </h4>                <div data-line="11.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        When ribbon grass is pulled up, the sod comes with it.<br>                        Each according to his kind.<br>                        Undertakings bring good fortune.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        In times of prosperity every able man called to fill an office draws like minded people along with him, just as in pulling up ribbon grass one always pulls up a bunch of it, because the stalks are connected by their roots.

It is during times of prosperity especially that we must always be ready to risk even dangerous undertakings, such as the crossing of a river, if they are necessary. So too we must not neglect what is distant but must attend scrupulously to everything. Factionalism and the dominance of cliques are especially to be avoided. Even if people of like mind come forward together, they ought not to form a faction by holding together for mutual advantage; instead, each man should do is duty. Theses are four ways in which one can overcome the hidden danger of a gradual slackening that always lurks in any time of peace.

This is why the text says here, "Perseverance brings good fortune and success," and not "Undertakings bring good fortune."

Success is assured only through greatest caution, which asks always, "What if it should fail?" When a mulberry bush is cut down, a number of unusually strong shoots sprout from the roots. Hence the image of tying something to a cluster of mulberry shoots is used to symbolize the way of making success certain. Confucius says about this line:<blockquote>Danger arises when a man feels secure in his position. Destruction threatens when a man seeks to preserve his worldly estate. Confusion develops when a man has put everything in order. Therefore the superior man does not forget danger in his security, not ruin when he is well established, nor confusion when his affairs are in order. In this way he gains personal safety and is able to protect the empire.</blockquote>                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="12.6" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine at the top means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        The standstill comes to an end.<br>                        First standstill, then good fortune.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        The standstill does not last forever.

Continuous effort is necessary to maintain peace: left to itself it would change into stagnation and disintegration. The time of disintegration, however, does not change back automatically to a condition of peace and prosperity; effort must be put forth in order to end it.

This hexagram forms a complement to <a href="#7">Shih, THE ARMY 7</a>. In the latter, danger is within and obedience without--the character of a warlike army, which, in order to hold together, needs one strong man among the many who are weak.

It is not the private interests of the individual that create lasting fellowship among men, but rather the goals of humanity. That is why it is said that fellowship with men in the open succeeds. If unity of this kind prevails, even difficult and dangerous tasks, such as crossing the great water, can be accomplished. But in order to bring about this sort of fellowship, a persevering and enlightened leader is needed--a man with clear, convincing, and inspiring aims and the strength to carry them out.

Fellowship should not be a mere mingling of individuals or of things--that would be chaos, not fellowship.

The mountain is the youngest son of the Creative, the representative of heaven and earth. It dispenses the blessings of heaven, the clouds and rain that gather round its summit, and thereafter shines forth radiant with heavenly light. This shows what modesty is and how it functions in great and strong men. K'un, the earth, stands above. Lowliness is a quality of the earth: this is the very reason why it appears in this hexagram as exalted, by being placed above the mountain. This shows how modesty functions in lowly, simple people: they are lifted up by it.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    MODESTY creates success.<br>                    The superior man carries things through.                </p>                <p data-book="jc">                      It is the law of heaven to make fullness empty and to make full what is modest; when the sun is at its zenith, it must, according to the law of heaven, turn toward its setting, and at its nadir it rises toward a new dawn. In obedience to the same law, the moon when it is full begins to wane, and when empty of light it waxes again. This heavenly law works itself out in the fates of men also. It is the law of earth to alter the full and to contribute to the modest. High mountains are worn down by the waters, and the valleys are filled up. It is the law of fate to undermine what is full and to prosper the modest. And men also hate fullness and love the modest. The destinies of men are subject to immutable laws that must fulfill themselves. But man has it in his power to shape his fate, according as his behavior exposes him to the influence of benevolent or of destructive forces. When a man holds a high position and is nevertheless modest, he shines with the light of wisdom; if he is in a lowly position and is modest, he cannot be passed by. Thus the superior man can carry out his work to the end without boasting of what he has achieved.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Within the earth, a mountain:<br>                    The image of MODESTY.<br>                    Thus the superior man reduces that which is too much,<br>                    And augments that which is too little.<br>                    He weighs things and makes them equal.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    The wealth of the earth in which a mountain is hidden is not visible to the eye, because the depths are offset by the height of the mountain. Thus high and low competent each other and the result is the plain. Here an effect that it took a long time to achieve, but that in the end seems easy of accomplishment and self-evident, is used as the image of modesty. The superior man does the same thing when he establishes order in the world; he equalizes the extremes that are the source of social discontent and thereby creates just and equable conditions.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES                </h4>                <div data-line="15.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        A superior man modest about his modesty<br>                        May cross the great water.<br>                        Good fortune.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        A dangerous enterprise, such as the crossing of a great stream, is made much more difficult if many claims and considerations have to be taken into account.

Therefore the unassuming attitude of mind that goes with modesty fits a man to accomplish even difficult undertakings: he imposes no demands or stipulations but settles matters easily and quickly.

If, on the contrary, he remains modest despite his merit, he makes himself beloved and wins the support necessary for carrying his work through to the end.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="15.4" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six in the fourth place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Nothing that would not further modesty<br>                        In movement.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        Everything has its proper measure. Even modesty in behavior can be carried too far. Here, however, it is appropriate, because the place between a worthy helper below and a kindly ruler above carries great responsibility. The confidence of the man in superior place must not be abused nor the merits of the man in inferior placed concealed. There are officials who indeed do not strive for prominence; they hide behind the letter of ordinances, decline all responsibility, accept pay without giving its equivalent in work, and bear empty titles. This is the opposite of what is meant here by modesty. In such a position, modesty is shown by interest in one's work.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="15.5" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six in the fifth place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        No boasting of wealth before one's neighbor. <br>                        It is favorable to attack with force.<br>                        Nothing that would not further.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        Modesty is not to be confused with weak good nature that lets things take their own course. When a man holds a responsible position, he must at times resort to energetic measures. In doing so he must not try to make an impression by boasting of his superiority but must make certain of the people around him. The measures taken should be purely objective and in no way personally offensive. Thus modesty manifests itself even in severity.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="15.6" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six at the top means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Modesty that comes to expression.<br>                        It is favorable to set armies marching<br>                        To chastise one's own city and one's country.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        A person who is really sincere in his modesty must make it show in reality. He must proceed with great energy in this. When enmity arises nothing is easier than to lay the blame on another. A weak man takes offense perhaps, and draws back, feeling self-pity; he thinks that it is modesty that keeps him from defending himself. Genuine modesty sets one to creating order and inspires one to begin by disciplining one's own ego and one's immediate circle. Only through having the courage to marshal one's armies against oneself, will something forceful really be achieved.                    </p>                </div>                <p class="tr index-link"><a href="#index" class="link silver ttu f5 tracked b">index</a></p>            </div>            <div class="hexagram hex16 mt6">                <a name="16"></a>                <h3 data-book="name">                    16.

This begins a movement that meets with devotion and therefore inspires enthusiasm, carrying all with it. Of great importance, furthermore, is the law of movement along the line of least resistance, which in this hexagram is enunciated as the law for natural events and for human life.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    ENTHUSIASM.

Hence he finds universal and willing obedience. To arouse enthusiasm it is necessary for a man to adjust himself and his ordinances to the character of those whom he has to lead. The inviolability of natural laws rests on this principle of movement along the line of least resistance. Theses laws are not forces external to things but represent the harmony of movement immanent in them. That is why the celestial bodies do not deviate from their orbits and why all events in nature occur with fixed regularity. It is the same with human society: only such laws are rooted in popular sentiment can be enforced, while laws violating this sentiment merely arouse resentment. Again, it is enthusiasm that enables us to install helpers for the completion of an undertaking without fear of secret opposition. It is enthusiasm too that can unify mass movements, as in war, so that they achieve victory.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Thunder comes resounding out of the earth:<br>                    The image of ENTHUSIASM.<br>                    Thus the ancient kings made music <br>                    In order to honor merit,<br>                    And offered it with splendor<br>                    To the Supreme Deity,<br>                    Inviting their ancestors to be present.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    When, at the beginning of summer, thunder--electrical energy--comes rushing forth from the earth again, and the first thunderstorm refreshes nature, a prolonged state of tension is resolved. Joy and relief make themselves felt. So too, music has power to ease tension within the heart and to loosen the grip of obscure emotions. The enthusiasm of the heart expresses itself involuntarily in a burst of song, in dance and rhythmic movement of the body. From immemorial times the inspiring effect of the invisible sound that moves all hearts, and draws them together, has mystified mankind. Rulers have made use of this natural taste for music; they elevated and regulated it. Music was looked upon as something serious and holy, designed to purify the feelings of men. It fell to music to glorify the virtues of heroes and thus to construct a bridge to the world of the unseen. In the temple men drew near to God with music and pantomimes (out of this later the theater developed). Religious feeling for the Creator of the world was united with the most sacred of human feelings, that of reverence for the ancestors. The ancestors were invited to these divine services as guests of the Ruler of Heaven and as representatives of humanity in the higher regions. This uniting of the human past with the Divinity in solemn moments of religious inspiration established the bond between God and man. The ruler who revered the Divinity in revering his ancestors became thereby the Son of Heaven, in whom the heavenly and the earthly world met in mystical contact. These ideas are the final summation of Chinese culture. Confucius has said of the great sacrifice at which these rites were performed: "He who could wholly comprehend this sacrifice could rule the world as though it were spinning on his hand."                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES                </h4>                <div data-line="16.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Enthusiasm that expresses itself<br>                        Brings misfortune.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        A man in an inferior position has aristocratic connections about which he boasts enthusiastically.

In his association with those beneath him, he is not arrogant. For he knows the seeds. The seeds are the first imperceptible beginning of movement, the first trace of good fortune (or misfortune) that shows itself. The superior man perceives the seeds and immediately takes action.

If a man would rule he must first learn to serve, for only in this way does he secure from those below him the joyous assent that is necessary if they are to follow him. If he has to obtain a following by force or cunning, by conspiracy or by creating faction, he invariably arouses resistance, which obstructs willing adherence. But even joyous movement can lead to evil consequences, hence the added stipulation, "Perseverance furthers" --that is, consistency in doing right-- together with "No blame." Just as we should not ask others to follow us unless this condition is fulfilled, so it is only under this condition that we can in turn follow others without coming to harm. The thought of obtaining a following through adaptation to the demands of the time is a great and significant idea; this is why the appended judgment is so favorable.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Thunder in the middle of the lake:<br>                    The image of FOLLOWING.<br>                    Thus the superior man at nightfall<br>                    Goes indoors for rest and recuperation.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    In the autumn electricity withdraws into the earth again and rests.

The idea of following in the sense of adaptation to the demands of the time grows out of this image. Thunder in the middle of the lake indicates times of darkness and rest. Similarly, a superior man, after being tirelessly active all day, allows himself rest and recuperation at night. No situation can become favorable until one is able to adapt to it and does not wear himself out with mistaken resistance.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES                </h4>                <div data-line="17.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        The standard is changing.<br>                        Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>                        To go out of the door in company<br>                        Produces deeds.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        There are exceptional conditions in which the relation between leader and followers changes.

At the same time, however, he must have firm principles, so that he does not vacillate where there is only a question of current opinion. Once we are ready to listen to the opinions of others, we must not associate exclusively with people who share our views or with members of our own party; instead, we must go out and mingle freely with all sorts of people, friends or foes.

IT is not immutable fate, as in the time of STANDSTILL, that has caused the state of corruption, but rather the abuse of human freedom. Work toward improving conditions promises well, because it accords the possibilities of the time. We must not recoil from work and danger-symbolized by crossing of the great water-but must take hold energetically. Success depends, however, on proper deliberation. This is expressed by the lines, "Before the starting point, three days. After the starting point, three days." We must first know the cause of corruption before we can do away with them; hence it is necessary to be cautious during the time before the start. Then we must see to it that the new way is safely entered upon, so that a relapse may be avoided; therefore we must pay attention to the time after the start. Decisiveness and energy must take the place of inertia and indifference that have led to decay, in order that the ending may be followed by a new beginning.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    The wind blows low on the mountain:<br>                    The image of DECAY.<br>                    Thus the superior man stirs up the people<br>                    And strengthens their spirit.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    When the wind blow s slow on the mountain, it is thrown back and spoils the vegetation.

The ancient explanations in the Book of Changes give as its first meaning, "becoming great." What becomes great are the two strong lines growing into the hexagram from below; the light-giving power expands with them. The meaning is then further extended to include the concept of approach, especially the approach of what is lower. Finally the meaning includes the attitude of condescension of a man in high position toward the people, and in general the setting to work on affairs. This hexagram is linked with the twelfth month (January-February), when after the winter solstice, the light power begins to ascend again.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    APPROACH has supreme success.<br>                    Perseverance furthers.<br>                    When the eighth month comes,<br>                    There will be misfortune.                </p>                <p data-book="jc">                      The hexagram as a whole points to a time of joyous, hopeful progress. Spring is approaching. Joy and forbearance bring high and low nearer together. Success is certain. But we must work with determination and perseverance to make full use of the propitiousness of the time. And on thing more: spring does not last forever. In the eighth month the aspects are reversed. Then only two strong, light lines are left; these do not advance but are in retreat (see next hexagram). We must take heed of this change in good time.

It means both contemplating and being seen, in the sense of being an example. These ideas are suggested by the fact that the hexagram can be understood as picturing a type of tower characteristic of ancient China. <br>                    A tower of this kind commanded a wide view of the country; at the same time, when situated on a mountain, it became a landmark that could be seen for miles around. Thus the hexagram shows a ruler who contemplates the law of heaven above him and the ways of the people below, and who, by means of good government, sets a lofty example to the masses. This hexagram is linked with the eight month (September-October). The light-giving power retreats and the dark power is again on the increase.

The ablution has been made, <br>                    But not yet the offering.<br>                    Full of trust they look up to him.                </p>                <p data-book="jc">                      The sacrificial ritual in China began with an ablution and a libation by which the Deity was invoked, after which the sacrifice was offered. The moment of time between these two ceremonies is the most sacred of all, the moment of deepest inner concentration. If piety is sincere and expressive of real faith, the contemplation of it has a transforming awe-spiring effect on those who witness it. Thus also in nature a holy seriousness is to be seen in the fact that natural occurrences are uniformly subject to law. Contemplation of the divine meaning underlying the workings of the universe gives to the man who is called upon to influence others the means of producing like effects. This requires that power of inner concentration which religious contemplation develops in great men strong in faith. It enables them to apprehend the mysterious and divine laws of life, and by means of profoundest inner concentration they give expression to these laws in their own persons. Thus a hidden spiritual power emanates from them, influencing and dominating others without their being aware of how it happens.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    The wind blows over the earth:<br>                    The image of CONTEMPLATION.<br>                    Thus the kings of old visited the regions of the world,<br>                    Contemplated the people,<br>                    And gave them instruction.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    When the wind blows over the earth it goes far and wide, and the grass must bend to its power. These two occurrences find confirmation in the hexagram. The two images are used to symbolize a practice of the kings of old; in making regular journeys the ruler could, in the first place, survey his realm and make certain that none of the existing usages of the people escaped notice; in the second, he could exert influence through which such customs as were unsuitable could be changed. All of this points to the power possessed by a superior personality. On the one hand, such a man will have a view of the real sentiments of the great mass of humanity and therefore cannot be deceived; on the other, he will impress the people so profoundly, by his mere existence and by the impact of his personality, that they will be swayed by him as the grass by the wind.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES                </h4>                <div data-line="20.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Boy like contemplation.<br>                        For an inferior man, no blame.<br>                        For a superior man, humiliation.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        This means contemplation from a distance, without comprehension. A man of influence is at hand, abut his influence is not understood by the common people. This matters little in the case of the masses, for they benefit by the actions of the ruling sage whether they understand them or not. But for a superior man it is a disgrace. He must not content himself with a shallow, thoughtless view of prevailing forces; he must contemplate them as a connected whole and try to understand them.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="20.2" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six in the second place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Contemplation through the crack of the door.<br>                        Furthering for the perseverance of a woman.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        Through the crack of the door one has a limited outlook; one looks outward from within. Contemplation is subjectively limited. One tends to relate everything to oneself and cannot put oneself in another's place and understand his motives. This is appropriate for a good housewife. It is not necessary for her to be conversant with the affairs of the world. But for a man who must take active part in public life, such a narrow, egotistic way of contemplating things is of course harmful.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="20.3" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six in the third place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Contemplation of my life <br>                        Decides the choice<br>                        Between advance and retreat.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        This is the place of transition. We no longer look outward to receive pictures that are more or less limited and confused, but direct out contemplation upon ourselves in order to find a guideline for our decisions. This self-contemplation means the overcoming of naive egotism in the person who sees everything solely form his own standpoint. He begins to reflect and in this way acquires objectivity. However, self-knowledge does not mean preoccupation with one's own thoughts; rather, it means concern about the effects one creates. It is only the effects our lives produce that give us the right to judge whether what we have done means progress or regression.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="20.4" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six in the fourth place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Contemplation of the light of the kingdom.<br>                        It furthers one to exert influence as the guest of a king.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        This describes a man who understands the secrets by which a kingdom can be made to flourish.

As a result the lips cannot meet. To bring them together one must bite energetically through the obstacle. Since the hexagram is made up of the trigrams for thunder and for lightning, it indicates how obstacles are forcibly removed in nature.<br>                    Energetic biting through overcomes the obstacle that prevents joining of the lips; the storm with its thunder and lightning overcomes the disturbing tension in nature. Recourse to law and penalties overcomes the disturbances of harmonious social life caused by criminals and slanderers. The theme of this hexagram is a criminal lawsuit, in contradistinction to that of <a href="#6">Sung, CONFLICT 6</a>, which refers to civil suits.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    BITING THROUGH has success.<br>                    It is favorable to let justice be administered.                </p>                <p data-book="jc">                      When an obstacle to union arises, energetic biting through brings success. This is true in all situations. Whenever unity cannot be established, the obstruction is due to a talebearer and traitor who is interfering and blocking the way. To prevent permanent injury, vigorous measures must be taken at once. Deliberate obstruction of this sort does not vanish of its own accord. Judgment and punishment are required to deter or obviate it. However, it is important to proceed in the right way. The hexagram combines Li, clarity, and Chên, excitement. Li is yielding, Chên is hard. Unqualified hardness and excitement would be too violent in meting out punishment; unqualified clarity and gentleness would be too weak. The two together create the just measure. It is of moment that the man who makes the decisions (represented by the fifth line) is gentle by nature, while he commands respect by his conduct in his position.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Thunder and lighting:<br>                    The image of BITING THROUGH.<br>                    Thus the kings of former times made firm the laws<br>                    Through clearly defined penalties.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    Penalties are the individual applications of the law.

In the lower trigram of fire a yielding line comes between two strong lines and makes them beautiful, but the strong lines are the essential content and the weak line is the beautifying form. In the upper trigram of the mountain, the strong line takes the lead, so that here again the strong element must be regarded as the decisive factor. In nature we see in the sky the strong light of the sun; the life of the world depends on it. But this strong, essential thing is changed and given pleasing variety by the moon and the stars. In human affairs, aesthetic form comes into being when traditions exist that, strong and abiding like mountains, are made pleasing by a lucid beauty. By contemplating the forms existing in the heavens we come to understand time and its changing demands. Through contemplation of the forms existing in human society it becomes possible to shape the world.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Fire at the foot of the mountain:<br>                    The image of GRACE.<br>                    Thus does the superior man proceed <br>                    When clearing up current affairs.<br>                    But he dare not decide controversial issues in this way.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    The fire, whose light illuminates the mountain and makes it pleasing, does not shine far; in the same way, beautiful form suffices to brighten and to throw light upon matters of lesser moment, but important questions cannot be decided in this way.

The powerful light that has been banished returns. There is movement, but it is not brought about by force. The upper trigram K'un is characterized by devotion; thus the movement is natural, arising spontaneously. For this reason the transformation of the old becomes easy. The old is discarded and the new is introduced. Both measures accord with the time; therefore no harm results. Societies of people sharing the same views are formed. But since these groups come together in full public knowledge and are in harmony with the time, all selfish separatist tendencies are excluded, and no mistake is made. The idea of RETURN is based on the course of nature. The movement is cyclic, and the course completes itself. Therefore it is not necessary to hasten anything artificially. Everything comes of itself at the appointed time. This is the meaning of heaven and earth. All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the seventh brings return. Thus the winter solstice, with which the decline of the year begins, comes in the seventh month after the summer solstice; so too sunrise comes in the seventh double hour after sunset. Therefore seven is the number of the young light, and it arises when six, the number of the great darkness, is increased by one. In this way the state of rest gives place to movement.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Thunder within the earth:<br>                    The image of THE TURNING POINT.<br>                    Thus the kings of antiquity closed the passes <br>                    At the time of solstice.<br>                    Merchants and strangers did not go about,<br>                    And the ruler<br>                    Did not travel through the provinces.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    The winter solstice has always been celebrated in China as the resting time of the year--a custom that survives in the time of rest observed at the new year. In winter the life energy, symbolized by thunder, the Arousing, is still underground. Movement is just at its beginning; therefore it must be strengthened by rest so that it will not be dissipated by being used prematurely. This principle, i.e., of allowing energy that is renewing itself to be reinforced by rest, applies to all similar situations. The return of health after illness, the return of understanding after an estrangement: everything must be treated tenderly and with care at the beginning, so that the return may lead to a flowering.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES                </h4>                <div data-line="24.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Return from a short distance.<br>                        No need for remorse.<br>                        Great good fortune.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        Slight digressions from the good cannot be avoided, but one must turn back in time, before going too far.

When, in accord with this, movement follows the law of heaven, man is innocent and without guile. His mind is natural and true, unshadowed by reflection or ulterior designs. For wherever conscious purpose is to be seen, there the truth and innocence of nature have been lost. Nature that is not directed by the spirit is not true but degenerate nature. Starting out with the idea of the natural, the train of thought in part goes somewhat further and thus the hexagram includes also the idea of the fundamental or unexpected.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    INNOCENCE.

By devotion to this divine spirit within himself, he attains an unsullied innocence that leads him to do right with instinctive sureness and without any ulterior thought of reward and personal advantage. This instinctive certainty brings about supreme success and 'furthers through perseverance". However, not everything instinctive is nature in this higher sense of the word, but only that which is right and in accord with the will of heaven. Without this quality of rightness, an unreflecting, instinctive way of acting brings only misfortune. Confucius says about this: "He who departs from innocence, what does he come to?

This produces great power, a situation in contrast to that of the ninth hexagram, Hsiao Ch'u, THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL, in which the Creative is tamed by the Gentle alone. There one weak line must tame five strong lines, but here four strong lines are restrained by two weak lines; in addition to a minister, there is a prince, and the restraining power therefore is afar stronger. The hexagram has a threefold meaning, expressing different aspects of the concept "Holding firm." Heaven within the mountain gives the idea of holding firm in the sense of holding together; the trigram Kên which holds the trigram ch'ien still, gives the idea of holding firm in the sense of holding back; the third idea is that of holding firm in the sense of caring for and nourishing. This last is suggested by the fact that a strong line at the top, which is the ruler of the hexagram, is honored and tended as a sage. The third of these meanings also attaches specifically to this strong line at the top, which represents the sage.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    THE TAMING POWER OF THE GREAT.<br>                    Perseverance furthers.<br>                    Not eating at home brings good fortune.<br>                    It furthers one to cross the great water.                </p>                <p data-book="jc">                      To hold firmly to great creative powers and store them up, as set forth in this hexagram, there is need of a strong, clear-headed man who is honored by the ruler. The trigram Ch'ein points to strong creative power; Kên indicates firmness and truth. Both point to light and clarity and to the daily renewal of character. Only through such daily self-renewal can a man continue at the height of his powers. Force of habit helps to keep order in quiet times; but in periods when there is a great storing up of energy, everything depends on the power of the personality. However, since the worthy are honored, as in the case of the strong personality entrusted with leadership by the ruler, it is an advantage not to eat at home but rather to earn one's bread by entering upon public office. Such a man is in harmony with heaven; therefore even great and difficult undertakings, such as crossing the great water, succeed.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Heaven within the mountain:<br>                    The image of THE TAMING POWER OF THE GREAT.<br>                    Thus the superior man acquaints himself with many sayings of antiquity<br>                    And many deeds of the past,<br>                    In order to strengthen his character thereby.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    Heaven within the mountain points to hidden treasures.

If we wish to know what anyone is like, we have only to observe on whom he bestows his care and what sides of his own nature he cultivates and nourishes. Nature nourishes all creatures. The great man fosters and takes care of superior men, in order to take care of all men through them. Mencius says about this:<blockquoteIf we wish to know whether anyone is superior or not, we need only observe what part of his being he regards as especially important. The body has superior and inferior, important and unimportant parts. We must not injure important parts for the sake of the unimportant, nor must we injure the superior parts for the sake of the inferior. He who cultivates the inferior parts of his nature is an inferior man. He who cultivates the superior parts of his nature is a superior man.</blockquote>                    </p>                    <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                        THE IMAGE                    </h4>                    <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                        At the foot of the mountain, thunder:<br>                        The image of PROVIDING NOURISHMENT.<br>                        Thus the superior man is careful of his words<br>                        And temperate in eating and drinking.                    </p>                    <p data-book="ic">                        "God comes forth in the sign of the Arousing": when in the spring the life forces stir again, all things comes into being anew.

This is an image of providing nourishment through movement and tranquillity. The superior man takes it as a pattern for the nourishment and cultivation of his character. Words are a movement going form within outward. Eating and drinking are movements from without inward. Both kinds of movement can be modified by tranquillity. For tranquillity keeps the words that come out of the mouth from exceeding proper measure, and keeps the food that goes into the mouth from exceeding its proper measure.

It is an exceptional time and situation; therefore extraordinary measures are demanded. It is necessary to find a way of transition as quickly as possible, and to take action. This promises success. For although the strong element is in excess, it is in the middle, that is, at the center of gravity, so that a revolution is not to be feared. Nothing is to be achieved by forcible measures. The problem must be solved by gently penetration to the meaning of the situation (as is suggested by the attribute of the inner trigram, Sun); then the change-over to other conditions will be successful. It demands real superiority; therefore the time when the great preponderates is a momentous time.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    The lake rises above the trees:<br>                    The image of PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT.<br>                    Thus the superior man, when he stands alone,<br>                    Is unconcerned,<br>                    And if he has to renounce the world,<br>                    He is undaunted.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    Extraordinary times when the great preponderates are like flood times when the lake rises over the treetops.

It is one of the eight hexagrams in which doubling occurs. The trigram K'an means a plunging in. A yang line has plunged in between two yin lines and is closed in by them like water in a ravine. The trigram K'an is also the middle son. The Receptive has obtained the middle line of the Creative, and thus K'an develops. As an image it represents water, the water that comes from above and is in motion on earth in streams and rivers, giving rise to all life on earth. In man's world K'an represents the heart, the soul locked up within the body, the principle of light inclosed in the dark--that is, reason. The name of the hexagram, because the trigram is doubled, has the additional meaning, "repetition of danger." Thus the hexagram is intended to designate an objective situation to which one must become accustomed, not a subjective attitude. For danger due to a subjective attitude means either foolhardiness or guile. Hence too a ravine is used to symbolize danger; it is a situation in which a man is in the same pass as the water in a ravine, and, like the water, he can escape if he behaves correctly.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    The Abysmal repeated.<br>                    If you are sincere, you have success in your heart,<br>                    And whatever you do succeeds.                </p>                <p data-book="jc">                      Through repetition of danger we grow accustomed to it. Water sets the example for the right conduct under such circumstances. It flows on and on, and merely fills up all the places through which it flows; it does not shrink from any dangerous spot nor from any plunge, and nothing can make it lose its own essential nature. It remains true to itself under all conditions. Thus likewise, if one is sincere when confronted with difficulties, the heart can penetrate the meaning of the situation. And once we have gained inner mastery of a problem, it will come about naturally that the action we take will succeed. In danger all that counts is really carrying out all that has to be done--thoroughness--and going forward, in order not to perish through tarrying in the danger. Properly used, danger can have an important meaning as a protective measure. Thus heaven has its perilous height protecting it against every attempt at invasion, and earth has its mountains and bodies of water, separating countries by their dangers. Thus also rulers make use of danger to protect themselves against attacks from without and against turmoil within.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Water flows on uninterruptedly and reaches its foal:<br>                    The image of the Abysmal repeated.<br>                    Thus the superior man walks in lasting virtue<br>                    And carries on the business of teaching.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    Water reaches its goal by flowing continually.

A dark line clings to two light lines, one above and one below--the image of an empty space between two strong lines, whereby the two strong lines are made bright. The trigram represents the middle daughter. The Creative has incorporated the central line of the Receptive, and thus Li develops. As an image, it is fire. Fire has no definite form but clings to the burning object and thus is bright. As water pours down from heaven, so fire flames up from the earth. While K'an means the soul shut within the body, Li stands for nature in its radiance.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    THE CLINGING.

A luminous thing giving out light must have within itself something that perseveres; otherwise it will in time burn itself out. Everything that gives light is dependent on something to which it clings, in order that it may continue to shine. Thus the sun and moon cling to heaven, and grain, grass, and trees cling to the earth. So too the twofold clarity of the dedicated man clings to what is right and thereby can shape the world. Human life on earth is conditioned and unfree, and when man recognizes this limitation and makes himself dependent upon the harmonious and beneficent forces of the cosmos, he achieves success. The cow is the symbol of extreme docility. By cultivating in himself an attitude of compliance and voluntary dependence, man acquires clarity without sharpness and finds his place in the world.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    That which is bright rises twice:<br>                    The image of FIRE.<br>                    Thus the great man, by perpetuating this brightness,<br>                    Illumines the four quarters of the world.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    Each of the two trigrams represents the sun in the course of a day.

The upper trigram is Tui, the Joyous; the lower is Kên, Keeping still. By its persistent, quiet influence, the lower, rigid trigram stimulates the upper, weak trigram, which responds to this stimulation cheerfully and joyously. Kên, the lower trigram, is the youngest son; the upper, Tui, is the youngest daughter. Thus the universal mutual attraction between the sexes is represented. In courtship, the masculine principle must seize the initiative and place itself below the feminine principle. Just as the first part of book 1 begins with the hexagrams of heaven and earth, the foundations of all that exists, the second part begins with the hexagrams of courtship and marriage, the foundations of all social relationships.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    Influence.

This brings about success, for all success depends on the effect of mutual attraction. By keeping still within while experiencing joy without, one can prevent the joy from going to excess and hold it within proper bounds. This is the meaning of the added admonition, "Perseverance furthers," for it is perseverance that makes the difference between seduction and courtship; in the latter the strong man takes a position inferior to that of the weak girl and shows consideration for her. This attraction between affinities is a general law of nature. Heaven and earth attract each other and thus all creatures come into being. Through such attraction the sage influences men's hearts, and thus the world attains peace. From the attractions they exert we can learn the nature of all beings in heaven and on earth.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    A lake on the mountain:<br>                    The image of influence.<br>                    Thus the superior man encourages people to approach him<br>                    By his readiness to receive them.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    A mountain with a lake on its summit is stimulated by the moisture from the lake.

When the quiet power of a man's own character is at work, the effects produced are right. All those who are receptive to the vibrations of such a spirit will then be influenced. Influence over others should not express itself as a conscious and willed effort to manipulate them. Through practicing such conscious incitement, one becomes wrought up and is exhausted by the eternal stress and strain. Moreover, the effects produced are then limited to those on whom one's thoughts are consciously fixed.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="31.5" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine in the fifth place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        The influence shows itself in the back of the neck.<br>                        No remorse.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        The back of the neck is the most rigid part of the body.

It is not a state of rest, for mere standstill is regression. Duration is rather the self-contained and therefore self-renewing movement of an organized, firmly integrated whole, taking place in accordance with immutable laws and beginning anew at every ending. The end is reached by an inward movement, by inhalation, systole, contraction, and this movement turns into a new beginning, in which the movement is directed outward, in exhalation, diastole, expansion. Heavenly bodies exemplify duration. They move in their fixed orbits, and because of this their light-giving power endures. The seasons of the year follow a fixed law of change and transformation, hence can produce effects that endure. So likewise the dedicated man embodies an enduring meaning in his way of life, and thereby the world is formed. In that which gives things their duration, we can come to understand the nature of all beings in heaven and on earth.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Thunder and wind: the image of DURATION.<br>                    Thus the superior man stands firm <br>                    And does not change has direction.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    Thunder rolls, and the wind blows; both are examples of extreme mobility and so are seemingly the very opposite of duration, but the laws governing their appearance and subsidence, their coming and going, endure.

What endures is the unswerving directive, the inner law of his being, which determines all his actions.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES                </h4>                <div data-line="32.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Seeking duration too hastily brings misfortune persistently.<br>                        Nothing that would further.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        Whatever endures can be created only gradually by long-continued work and careful reflection.

The light retreats to security, so that the dark cannot encroach upon it. This retreat is a matter not of man's will but of natural law. Therefore in this case withdrawal is proper; it is the correct way to behave in order not to exhaust one's forces. In the calendar this hexagram is linked with the sixth month (July-August), in which the forces of winter are already showing their influence.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    RETREAT.

In this case retreat is the right course, and it is not to be confused with flight. Flight means saving oneself under any circumstances, whereas retreat is a sign of strength. We must be careful not to miss the right moment while we are in full possession of power and position. Then we shall be able to interpret the signs of the time before it is too late and to prepare for provisional retreat instead of being drawn into a desperate life-and-death struggle. Thus we do not simple abandon the field to the opponent; we make it difficult for him to advance by showing perseverance in single acts of resistance. In this way we prepare, while retreating, for the counter-movement. Understanding the laws of a constructive retreat of this sort is not easy. The meaning that lies hidden in such a time is important.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Mountain under heaven: the image of RETREAT.<br>                    Thus the superior man keeps the inferior man at a distance,<br>                    Not angrily but with reserve.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    The mountain rises up under heaven, but owing to its nature it finally comes to a stop. Heaven on the other hand retreats upward before it into the distance and remains out of reach. This symbolizes the behavior of the superior man toward a climbing inferior; he retreats into his own thoughts as the inferior man comes forward. He does not hate him, for hatred is a form of subjective involvement by which we are bound to the hated object. The superior man shows strength (heaven) in that he brings the inferior man to a standstill (mountain) by his dignified reserve.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES                </h4>                <div data-line="33.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        At the tail in retreat.

In a retreat it is advantageous to be at the front. Here one is at the back, in immediate contact with the pursuing enemy. This is dangerous, and under such circumstances it is not advisable to undertake anything. Keeping still is the easiest way of escaping from the threatening danger.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="33.2" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six in the second place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        He holds him fast with yellow oxhide.<br>                        No one can tear him loose.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        Yellow is the color of the middle.

While the superior men retreat and the inferior press after them, the inferior man represented here holds on so firmly and tightly to the superior man that the latter cannot shake him off. And because he is in quest of what is right an so strong in purpose, he reaches his goal. Thus the line confirms what is said in the Judgment: "In what is small" --here equivalent to "in the inferior man" -- "perseverance furthers."                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="33.3" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine in the third place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        A halted retreat <br>                        Is nerve-wracking and dangerous.<br>                        To retain people as men- and maidservants<br>                        Brings good fortune.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        When it is time to retreat it is both unpleasant and dangerous to be held back, because then one no longer has freedom of action.

But its strength has already passed beyond the median line, hence there is danger that one may rely entirely on one's own power and forget to ask what is right. There is danger too that, being intent on movement, we may not wait for the right time. Therefore the added statement that perseverance furthers. For that is truly great power which does not degenerate into mere force but remains inwardly united with the fundamental principles of right and of justice. When we understand this point--namely, that greatness and justice must be indissolubly united--we understand the true meaning of all that happens in heaven and on earth.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Thunder in heaven above:<br>                    The image of THE POWER OF THE GREAT.<br>                    Thus the superior man does not tread upon paths<br>                    That do not accord with established order.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    Thunder--electrical energy--mounts upward in the spring.

However, true greatness depends on being in harmony with what is right.

In the latter a wise man at the head of affairs has able helpers, and in company with them makes progress; here a man of dark nature is in a position of authority and brings harm to the wise and able man.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    DARKENING OF THE LIGHT.

In some situations indeed a man must hide his light, in order to make his will prevail inspite of difficulties in his immediate environment.

On the other hand, the two strong lines in the fifth and the third place represent two brothers, and the two weak lines correlated with them in the fourth and the second place stand for their respective wives. Thus all the connections and relationships within the family find their appropriate expression. Each individual line has the character according with its place. The fact that a strong line occupies the sixth place-where a weak line might be expected-indicates very clearly the strong leadership that must come from the head of the family. The line is to be considered here not in its quality as the sixth but in its quality as the top line. THE FAMILY shows the laws operative within the household that, transferred to outside life, keep the state and the world in order. The influence that goes out from within the family is represented by the symbol of the wind created by fire.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    THE FAMILY.

The tie that hold the family together lies in the loyalty and perseverance of the wife. The tie that holds the family together lies in the loyalty and perseverance of the wife. Her place is within (second line), while that of the husband is without (fifth line). It is in accord with the great laws of nature that husband and wife take their proper places. Within the family a strong authority is needed; this is represented by the parents. If the father is really a father and the son a son, if the elder brother fulfills his position, and the younger fulfills his, if the husband is really a husband and the wife a wife, then the family is in order. When the family is in order, all the social relationships of mankind will be in order. Three of the five social relationships are to be found within the family-that between father and son, which is the relation of love, that between the husband and wife, which is the relation of chaste conduct, and that between elder and younger brother, which is the relation of correctness. The loving reverence of the son is then carried over to the prince in the form of faithfulness to duty; the affection and correctness of behavior existing between the two brothers are extended to a friend in the form of loyalty, and to a person of superior rank in the form of deference. The family is society in the embryo; it is the native soil on which performance of moral duty is made early through natural affection, so that within a small circle a basis of moral practice is created, and this is later widened to include human relationships in general.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Wind comes forth from fire:<br>                    The image of THE FAMILY.<br>                    Thus the superior man has substance in his words<br>                    And duration in his way of life.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    Heat creates energy: this is signified by the wind stirred up by the fire and issuing forth form it.

In order to be capable of producing such an influence, one's words must have power, and this they can have only if they are based on something real, just as flame depends on its fuel Words have influence only when they are pertinent and clearly related to definite circumstances. General discourses and admonitions have no effect whatsoever. Furthermore, the words must be supported by one's entire conduct, just as the wind is made effective by am impression on others that they can adapt and conform to it.

In such circumstances one should above all not proceed brusquely, for that would only increase the existing opposition; instead, one should limit oneself to producing gradual effects in small matters. Here success can still be expected, because the situation is such that the opposition does not preclude all agreement. In general, opposition appears as an obstruction, but when it represents polarity within a comprehensive whole, it has also its useful and important functions. The oppositions of heaven and earth, spirit and nature, man and woman, when reconciled, bring about the creation and reproduction of life. In the world of visible things, the principle of opposites makes possible the differentiation by categories through which order is brought into the world.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Above, fire; below.

When opposition begins to manifest itself, a man must not try to bring about unity by force, for by so doing he would only achieve the contrary, just as a horse goes farther and farther away if one runs after it. It it is one's won horse, one can safely let it go; it will come back of its own accord. So too when someone who belongs with us is momentarily estranged because of a misunderstanding, he will return of his own accord if we leave matters to him. One the other hand, it is well to be cautious when evil men who do not belong with us force themselves upon us, again as the result of a misunderstanding. Here the important thing is to avoid mistakes. We must not try to shake off these evil men by force; this would give rise to real hostility. We must simply endure them. They will eventually withdraw of their own accord.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="38.2" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine in the second place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        One meets his lord in a narrow street.<br>                        No blame.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        As a result of misunderstandings, it has become impossible for people who by nature belong together to meet in the correct way.

One thing is important, however: in such times we must not overdo our triumph. The point is not to push on farther than is necessary. Returning to the regular order of life as soon as deliverance is achieved brings good fortune.

If the foundations of a building are decreased in strength and the upper walls are strengthened, the whole structure loves its stability. Likewise, a decrease in the prosperity of the people in favor of the government is out-and-out decrease.

Indeed, there need by no concern if the outward beauty of the civilization, even the elaboration of religious forms, should have to suffer because of simplicity. One must draw on the strength of the inner attitude to compensate for what is lacking in externals; then the power of the content makes up for the simplicity of form.

Confucius says about this line:<blockquote>The superior man sets his person at rest before he moves; he composes his mind before he speaks; he makes his relations firm before he asks for something. By attending to these three matters, the superior man gains complete security. But if a man is brusque in his movements, others will not cooperate. If he is agitated in his word, they awaken no echo in others. If he asks for something without having fist established relations, it will not be given to him. If no one is with him, those who would harm him draw near.</blockquote>                    </p>                </div>                <p class="tr index-link"><a href="#index" class="link silver ttu f5 tracked b">index</a></p>            </div>            <div class="hexagram hex43 mt6">                <a name="43"></a>                <h3 data-book="name">                    43.

Even a single passion still lurking in the heart has power to obscure reason. Passion and reason cannot exist side by side-therefore fight without quarter is necessary if the good is to prevail. In a resolute struggle of the good against evil, there are, however, definite rules that must not be disregarded, if it is to succeed. First, resolution must be based on a union of strength and friendliness. Second, a compromise with evil is not possible; evil must under all circumstances be openly discredited. Nor must our own passions and shortcomings be glossed over. Third, the struggle must not be carried on directly by force. If evil is branded, it thinks of weapons, and if we do it the favor of fighting against it blow for blow, we lose in the end because thus we ourselves get entangled in hatred and passion. Therefore it is important to begin at home, to be on guard in our own persons against the faults we have branded. In this way, finding no opponent, the sharp edges of the weapons of evil becomes dulled. For the same reasons we should not combat our own faults directly. As long as we wrestle with them, they continue victorious. Finally, the best way to fight evil is to make energetic progress in the good.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    The lake has risen up to heaven:<br>                    The image of BREAK-THROUGH.<br>                    Thus the superior man<br>                    Dispenses riches downward<br>                    And refrains from resting on his virtue.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    When the water of a lake has risen up to heaven, there is reason to fear a cloudburst.

If a man were to pile up riches for himself alone, without considering others, he would certainly experience a collapse. For all gathering is followed by dispersion.

The task of the superior man becomes extremely difficult here. He must be firmly resolved within himself and, while maintaining association with the inferior man, avoid any participation in his evilness. He will of course be misjudged. It will be thought that he belong to the party of the inferior man. He will be lonely because no one will understand him. His relations with the inferior man will sully him in the eyes of the multitude, and they will turn against him, grumbling. But he can endure this lack of appreciation and makes no mistake, because he remains true to himself.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="43.4" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine in the fourth place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        There is no skin on his thighs,<br>                        And walking comes hard.<br>                        If a man were to let himself be led like a sheep,<br>                        Remorse would disappear.<br>                        But if these words are heard.<br>                        They will not be believed.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        Here a man is suffering from inner restlessness and cannot abide in his place.

Of its own accord the female principle comes to meet the male. It is an unfavorable and dangerous situation, and we must understand and promptly prevent the possible consequences. The hexagram is linked with the fifth month [June-July], because at the summer solstice the principle of darkness gradually becomes ascendant again.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    COMING TO MEET.

This would not be possible if the strong and light-giving element had not in turn come halfway. The inferior thing seems so harmless and inviting that a man delights in it; it looks so small and weak that he imagines he may dally with it and come to no harm. The inferior man rises only because the superior man does not regard him as dangerous and so lends him power. If he were resisted from the fist, he could never gain influence. The time of COMING TO MEET is important in still another way. Although as a general rule the weak should not come to meet the strong, there are times when this has great significance. When heaven and earth come to meet each other, all creatures prosper; when a prince and his official come to meet each other, the world is put in order. It is necessary for elements predestined to be joined and mutually dependent to come to meet one another halfway. But the coming together must be free of dishonest ulterior motives, otherwise harm will result.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Under heaven, wind:<br>                    The image of COMING TO MEET.<br>                    Thus does the prince act when disseminating his commands<br>                    And proclaiming them to the four quarters of heaven.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    The situation here resembles that in hexagram 20, Kuan, CONTEMPLATION ( VIEW).

There the wind is on the earth and symbolizes the ruler taking note of the conditions in his kingdom; here the wind blows from above and symbolizes the influence exercised by the ruler through his commands. Heaven is far from the things of earth, but it sets them in motion by means of the wind. The ruler is far form his people, but he sets them in motion by means of his commands and decrees.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES                </h4>                <div data-line="44.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        It must be checked with a brake of bronze.<br>                        Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>                        If one lets it take its course, one experiences misfortune.<br>                        Even a lean pig has it in him to rage around.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        If an inferior element has wormed its way in, it must be energetically checked at once.

The family gathers about the father as its head. The perpetuation of this gathering in groups is achieved through the sacrifice to the ancestors, at which the whole clan is gathered together. Through the collective piety of the living members of the family, the ancestors become so integrated in the spiritual life of the family that it cannot be dispersed or dissolved. Where men are to be gathered together, religious forces are needed. But there must also be a human leader to serve as the center of the group. In order to be able to bring others together, this leader must first of all be collected within himself. Only collective moral force can unite the world. Such great times of unification will leave great achievements behind them. This is the significance of the great offerings that are made. In the secular sphere likewise there is no need of great deeds in the time of GATHERING TOGETHER.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Over the earth, the lake:<br>                    The image of GATHERING TOGETHER.<br>                    Thus the superior man renews his weapons<br>                    In order to meet the unforeseen.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    If the water in the lake gathers until it rises above the earth, there is danger of a break-through.

Linked with this is the idea that wood in the earth grows upward. In contrast to the meaning of <a href="#35">Chin, PROGRESS 35</a>, this pushing upward is associated with effort, just as a plant needs energy for pushing upward through the earth. That is why this hexagram, although it is connected with success, is associated with effort of the will.

The pushing upward is made possible not by violence but by modesty and adaptability. Since the individual is borne along by the propitiousness of the time, he advances. He must go to see authoritative people. He need not be afraid to do this, because success is assured.

Here a disagreeable situation must be overcome by patience of spirit.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="47.3" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six in the third place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        A man permits himself to be oppressed by stone,<br>                        And leans on thorns and thistles.<br>                        He enters the house and does not see his wife.<br>                        Misfortune.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        This shows a man who is restless and indecisive in times of adversity. At first he wants to push ahead, then he encounters obstructions that, it is true, mean oppression only when recklessly dealt with. He butts his head against a wall and in consequence feels himself oppressed by the wall. Then he leans on things that have in themselves no stability and that are merely a hazard for him who leans on them. Thereupon he turns back irresolutely and retires into his house, only to find, as a fresh disappointment, that his wife is not there. Confucius says about this line:<blockquote>If a man permits himself to be oppressed by something that ought not to oppress him, his name will certainly be disgraced. If he leans on things upon which one cannot lean, his life will certainly be endangered. For him who is in disgrace and danger, the hour of death draws near; how can he then still see his wife?</blockquote>                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="47.4" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine in the fourth place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        He comes very quietly, oppressed in a golden carriage.<br>                        Humiliation, but the end is reached.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        A well-to-do man sees the need of the lower classes and would like very much to be of help.

The wood represents not the buckets, which in ancient times were made of clay, but rather the wooden poles by which the water is hauled up from the well. The image also refers to the world of plants, which lift water out of the earth by means of their fibers. The well from which water is drawn conveys the further idea of an inexhaustible dispensing of nourishment.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    THE WELL.

The style of architecture changed in the course of centuries, but the shape of the well has remained the same from ancient times to this day. Thus the well is the symbol of that social structure which, evolved by mankind in meeting its most primitive needs, is independent of all political forms. Political structures change, as do nations, but the life of man with its needs remains eternally the same-this cannot be changed. Life is also inexhaustible. It grows neither less not more; it exists for one and for all. The generations come and go, and all enjoy life in its inexhaustible abundance. However, there are two prerequisites for a satisfactory political or social organization of mankind. We must go down to the very foundations of life. For any merely superficial ordering of life that leaves its deepest needs unsatisfied is as ineffectual as if no attempt at order had ever been made. Carelessness-by which the jug is broken-is also disastrous. If for instance the military defense of a state is carried to such excess that it provokes wars by which the power of the state is annihilated, this is a breaking of the jug. This hexagram applies also to the individual. However men may differ in disposition and in education, the foundations of human nature are the same in everyone. And every human being can draw in the course of his education from the inexhaustible wellspring of the divine in man's nature. But here likewise two dangers threaten: a man may fail in his education to penetrate to the real roots of humanity and remain fixed in convention-a partial education of this sort is as bad as none- or he may suddenly collapse and neglect his self-development.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Water over wood: the image of THE WELL.<br>                    Thus the superior man encourages the people at their work,<br>                    And exhorts them to help one another.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    The trigram Sun, wood, is below, and the trigram K'an, water, is above it.

In conformity with the new order, they likewise "molt." This molting, it is true, does not go very deep, but that is not to be expected. We must be satisfied with the attainable. If we should go too far and try to achieve too much, it would lead to unrest and misfortune. For the object of a great revolution is the attainment of clarified, secure conditions ensuring a general stabilization on the basis of what is possible at the moment.                    </p>                </div>                <p class="tr index-link"><a href="#index" class="link silver ttu f5 tracked b">index</a></p>            </div>            <div class="hexagram hex50 mt6">                <a name="50"></a>                <h3 data-book="name">                    50.

At the same time, the image suggests the idea of nourishment. The ting, cast of bronze, was the vessel that held the cooked viands in the temple of the ancestors and at banquets. The heads of the family served the food from the ting into the bowls of the guests. <a href="#48">THE WELL 48</a> likewise has the secondary meaning of giving nourishment, but rather more in relation to the people. The ting, as a utensil pertaining to a refined civilization, suggests the fostering and nourishing of able men, which redounded to the benefit of the state. This hexagram and THE WELL are the only two in the Book of Changes that represent concrete, men-made objects. Yet here too the thought has its abstract connotation. Sun, below, is wood and wind; Li, above, is flame. Thus together they stand for the flame kindled by wood and wind, which likewise suggests the idea of preparing food.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    THE CALDRON.

Here it is the wood that serves as nourishment for the flame, the spirit. All that is visible must grow beyond itself, extend into the realm of the invisible. Thereby it receives its true consecration and clarity and takes firm root in the cosmic order. Here we see civilization as it reaches its culmination in religion. The ting serves in offering sacrifice to God. The highest earthly values must be sacrificed to the divine. But the truly divine does not manifest itself apart from man. The supreme revelation of God appears in prophets and holy men. To venerate them is true veneration of God. The will of God, as revealed through them, should be accepted in humility; this brings inner enlightenment and true understanding of the world, and this leads to great good fortune and success.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Fire over wood:<br>                    The image of THE CALDRON.<br>                    Thus the superior man consolidates his fate <br>                    By making his position correct.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    The fate of fire depends on wood; as long as there is wood below, the fire burns above.

And if he succeeds in assigning the right place to life and to fate, thus bringing the two into harmony, he puts his fate on a firm footing. These words contain hints about fostering of life as handed on by oral tradition in the secret teachings of Chinese yoga.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES                </h4>                <div data-line="50.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        A ting with legs upturned.<br>                        Furthers removal of stagnating stuff.<br>                        One takes a concubine for the sake of her son.<br>                        No blame.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        If a ting is turned upside down before being used, no harm is done-on the contrary, this clears it of refuse. A concubine's position is lowly, but because she has a son she comes to be honored. These two metaphors express the idea that in a highly developed civilization, such as that indicated by this hexagram, every person of good will can in some way or other succeed. No matter how lowly he may be, provided he is ready to purify himself, he is accepted. He attains a station in which he can prove himself fruitful in accomplishment, and as a result he gains recognition.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="50.2" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine in the second place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        There is food in the ting.<br>                        My comrades are envious,<br>                        But they cannot harm me.<br>                        Good fortune.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        In a period of advanced culture, it is of the greatest importance that one should achieve something significant.

If the handle is altered, the ting cannot be lifted up and used, and, sad to say, the delicious food in it, such as pheasant fat, cannot be eaten by anyone. This describes a man who, in a highly evolved civilization, finds himself in a place where no one notices or recognizes him. This is a severe block to his effectiveness. All of his good qualities and gifts of mind thus needlessly go to waste. But if he will only see to it that he is possessed of something truly spiritual, the time is bound to come, sooner or later, when the difficulties will be resolved and all will go well. The fall of rain symbolizes here, as in other instances, release of tension.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="50.4" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine in the fourth place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        The legs of the ting are broken.<br>                        The prince's meal is spilled<br>                        And his person is soiled.<br>                        Misfortune.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        A man has a difficult and responsible task to which he is not adequate.

This is the spirit that must animate leaders and rulers of men-a profound inner seriousness from which all terrors glance off harmlessly.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Thunder repeated: the image of SHOCK.<br>                    Thus in fear and trembling<br>                    The superior man sets his life in order<br>                    And examines himself.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    The shock of continuing thunder brings fear and trembling.

The male principle is at the top because it strives upward by nature; the female principle is below, since the direction of its movement has come to its normal end. In its application to man, the hexagram turns upon the problem of achieving a quiet heart. It is very difficult to bring quiet to the heart. While Buddhism strives for rest through an ebbing away of all movement in nirvana, the Book of Changes holds that rest is merely a state of polarity that always posits movement as its complement. Possibly the words of the text embody directions for the practice of yoga.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    KEEPING STILL.

In this way rest and movement are in agreement with the demands of the time, and thus there is light in life. The hexagram signifies the end and the beginning of all movement. The back is named because in the back are located all the nerve fibers that mediate movement. If the movement of these spinal nerves is brought to a standstill, the ego, with its restlessness, disappears as it were. When a man has thus become calm, he may turn to the outside world. He no longer sees in it the struggle and tumult of individual beings, and therefore he has that true peace of mind which is needed for understanding the great laws of the universe and for acting in harmony with them.

The various formalities must be disposed of before the marriage takes place. This principle of gradual development can be applied to other situations as well; it is always applicable where it is a matter of correct relationships of co-operation, as for instance in the appointment of an official. The development must be allowed to take its proper course. Hasty action would not be wise. This is also true, finally, of any effort to exert influence on others, for here too the essential factor is a correct way of development through cultivation of one's own personality. No influence such as that exerted by agitators has a lasting effect. Within the personality too, development must follow the same course if lasting results are to be achieved. Gentleness that is adaptable, but at the same time penetrating, is the outer form that should proceed from inner calm. The very gradualness of the development makes it necessary to have perseverance, for perseverance alone prevents slow progress from dwindling to nothing.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    On the mountain, a tree:<br>                    The image of DEVELOPMENT.<br>                    Thus the superior man abides in dignity and virtue,<br>                    In order to improve the mores.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    The tree on the mountain is visible from afar, and its development influences the landscape of the entire region.

Progress must be quite gradual, and in order to obtain such progress in public opinion and in the mores of the people, it is necessary for the personality to acquire influence and weight. This comes about through careful and constant work on one's own moral development.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES                </h4>                <div data-line="53.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        The wild goose gradually draws near the shore.<br>                        The young son is in danger.<br>                        There is talk.

The situation is that of a lonely young man who is just starting out to make his way in life. Since no one comes to help him, his first steps are slow and hesitant, and he is surrounded by danger. Naturally he is subjected to much criticism. But these very difficulties keep him from being too hasty, and his progress is successful.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="53.2" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six in the second place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        The wild goose gradually draws near the cliff.<br>                        Eating and drinking in peace and concord.<br>                        Good fortune.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        The cliff is a safe place on shore.

The same is true of all voluntary relationships between human beings. While legally regulated relationships based on personal inclination depend in the long run entirely on tactful reserve. Affection as the essential principle of relatedness is of the greatest importance in all relationships in the world. For the union of heaven and earth is the origin of the whole of nature. Among human beings likewise, spontaneous affection is the all-inclusive principle of union.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Thunder over the lake:<br>                    The image of THE MARRYING MAIDEN.<br>                    Thus the superior man<br>                    Understands the transitory<br>                    In the light of the eternity of the end.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    Thunder stirs the water of the lake, which follows it in shimmering waves.

But every relationship between individuals bears within it the danger that wrong turns may be taken, leading to endless misunderstandings and disagreements. Therefore it is necessary constantly to remain mindful of the end. If we permit ourselves to drift along, we come together and are parted again as the day may determine. If on the other hand a man fixes his mind on an end that endures, he will succeed in avoiding the reefs that confront the closer relationships of people.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES                </h4>                <div data-line="54.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        The marrying maiden as a concubine.<br>                        A lame man who is able to tread.<br>                        Undertakings bring good fortune.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        The princess of ancient China maintained a fixed order of rank among the court ladies, who were subordinated to the queen as are younger sisters to the eldest. Frequently they came from the family of the queen, who herself led them to her husband. The meaning is that a girl entering a family with the consent of the wife will not rank outwardly as the equal of the latter but will withdraw modestly into the background. However, if she understands how to fit herself into the pattern of things, her position will be entirely satisfactory, and she will feel sheltered in the love of the husband to whom she bears children. The same meaning is brought out in the relationships between officials. A man may enjoy the personal friendship of a prince and be taken into his confidence. Outwardly this man must keep tactfully in the background behind the official ministers of state, but, although he is hampered by this status, as if he were lame, he can nevertheless accomplish something through the kindliness of his nature.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="54.2" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine in the second place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        A one-eyed man who is able to see.<br>                        The perseverance of a solitary man furthers.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        Here the situation is that of a girl married to a man who has disappointed her.

However, the fact that development has reached a peak suggests that this extraordinary condition of abundance cannot be maintained permanently.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    ABUNDANCE has success.<br>                    The king attains abundance.<br>                    Be not sad.<br>                    Be like the sun at midday.                </p>                <p data-book="jc">                      It is not given to every mortal to bring about a time of outstanding greatness and abundance. Only a born ruler of men is able to do it, because his will is directed to what is great. Such a time of abundance is usually brief. Therefore a sage might well feel sad in view of the decline that must follow. But such sadness foes not befit him. Only a man who is inwardly free of sorrow and care can lead in a time of abundance. He must be like the sun at midday, illuminating and gladdening everything under heaven.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Both thunder and lightning come:<br>                    The image of ABUNDANCE.<br>                    Thus the superior man decides lawsuits<br>                    And carries out punishments.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    This hexagram has a certain connection with Shih Ho, <a href="#21">BITING THROUGH 21</a>, in which thunder and lightning similarly appear together, but in the reverse order.

If a man at such a time were to try to take energetic measures, he would encounter only mistrust and envy, which would prohibit all movement.

This makes it impossible for an able man, though he might be the right hand of the ruler, to undertake anything.

It is the eldest daughter and symbolizes wind or wood; it has for its attribute gentleness, which nonetheless penetrates like the wind or like growing wood with its roots. The dark principle, in itself rigid and immovable, is dissolved by the penetrating light principle, to which it subordinates itself in gentleness. In nature, it is the wind that disperses the gathered clouds, leaving the sky clear and serene. In human life it is penetrating clarity of judgment that thwarts all dark hidden motives. In the life of the community it is the powerful influence of a great personality that uncovers and breaks up those intrigues which shun the light of day.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    THE GENTLE.

Results of this kind are less striking to the eye than those won by surprise attack, but they are more enduring and more complete. If one would produce such effects, one must have a clearly defined goal, for only when the penetrating influence works always in the same direction can the object be attained.

Contrary to appearances, it is not the yielding quality of the top line that accounts for joy here. The attribute of the yielding or dark principle is not joy but melancholy. However, joy is indicated by the fact that there are two strong lines within, expressing themselves through the medium of gentleness.

In this way one assumes the right attitude toward God and man and achieves something. Under certain conditions, intimidation without gentleness may achieve something momentarily, but not for all time. When, on the other hand, the hearts of men are won by friendliness, they are led to take all hardships upon themselves willingly, and if need be will not shun death itself, so great is the power of joy over men.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Lakes resting one on the other:<br>                    The image of THE JOYOUS.<br>                    Thus the superior man joins with his friends<br>                    For discussion and practice.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    A lake evaporates upward and thus gradually dries up; but when two lakes are joined they do not dry up so readily, for one replenishes the other.

In the latter, the subject is the bringing together of elements that have been separated, as water collects in lakes upon the earth. Here the subject is the dispersing and dissolving of divisive egotism. DISPERSION shows the way, so to speak, that leads to gathering together. This explains the similarity of the two texts. Religious forces are needed to overcome the egotism that divides men. The common celebration of the great sacrificial feasts and sacred rites, which gave expression simultaneously to the interrelation and social articulation of the family and state, was the means of employed by the great ruler to unite men. The sacred music and the splendor of the ceremonies aroused a strong tide of emotion that was shared by all hearts in unison, and that awakened a consciousness of the common origin of all creatures. In this way disunity was overcome and rigidity dissolved. A further means to the same end is co-operation in great general undertakings that set a high goal for the will of the people; in the common concentration on this goal, all barriers dissolve, just as, when a boat is crossing a great stream, all hands must unite in a joint task. But only a man who is himself free of all selfish ulterior considerations, and who perseveres in justice and steadfastness, is capable of so dissolving the hardness of egotism.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    The wind drives over the water:<br>                    The image of DISPERSION.<br>                    Thus the kings of old sacrificed to the Lord<br>                    And built temples.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    In the autumn and winter, water begins to freeze into ice.

Through hardness and selfishness the heart grows rigid, and this rigidity leads to separation from all others. Egotism and cupidity isolate men. Therefore the hearts of men must be seized by a devout emotion.

When more water comes into it, it overflows. Therefore limits must be set for the water. The image shows water below and water above, with the firmament between them as a limit. The Chinese word for limitation really denotes the joints that divide a bamboo stalk. In relation to ordinary life it means the thrift that sets fixed limits upon expenditures. In relation to the moral sphere it means the fixed limits that the superior man sets upon his actions-the limits of loyalty and disinterestedness.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    LIMITATION.

If we live economically in normal times, we are prepared for times of want. To be sparing saves us from humiliation. Limitations are also indispensable in the regulation of world conditions. In nature there are fixed limits for summer and winter, day and night, and these limits give the year its meaning. In the same way, economy, by setting fixed limits upon expenditures, acts to preserve property and prevent injury to the people. But in limitation we must observe due measure. If a man should seek to impose galling limitations upon his own nature, it would be injurious. And if he should go too far in imposing limitations on others, they would rebel. Therefore it is necessary to set limits even upon limitation.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Water over lake: the image of LIMITATION.<br>                    Thus the superior man<br>                    Creates number and measure,<br>                    And examines the nature of virtue and correct conduct.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    A lake is something limited. Water is inexhaustible. A lake can contain only a definite amount of the infinite quantity of water; this is its peculiarity. In human life too the individual achieves significance through discrimination and the setting of limits. Therefore what concerns us here is the problem of clearly defining these discriminations, which are, so to speak, the backbone of morality. Unlimited possibilities are not suited to man; if they existed, his life would only dissolve in the boundless. To become strong, a man's life needs the limitations ordained by duty and voluntarily accepted. The individual attains significance as a free spirit only by surrounding himself with these limitations and by determining for himself what his duty is.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES                </h4>                <div data-line="60.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Not going out of the door and the courtyard<br>                        Is without blame.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        Often a man who would like to undertake something finds himself confronted by insurmountable limitations. Then he must know where to stop. If he rightly understands this and does not go beyond the limits set for him, he accumulates an energy that enables him, when the proper time comes, to act with great force. Discretion is of prime importance in preparing the way for momentous things. Concerning this, Confucius says: <blockquote>Where disorder develops, words are the first steps. If the prince is not discreet, he loses his servant. If the servant is not discreet he loses his life. If germinating things are not handled with discretion, the perfecting of them is impeded. Therefore the superior man is careful to maintain silence and does not go forth.</blockquote>                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="60.2" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine in the second place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Not going out of the gate and the courtyard<br>                        Brings misfortune.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        When the time for action has come, the moment must be quickly seized.

Thus visible effects of the invisible manifest themselves. The hexagram consists of firm lines above and below, while it is open in the center. This indicates a heart free of prejudices and therefore open to truth. On the other hand, each of the two trigrams has a firm line in the middle; this indicates the force of inner truth in the influences they present. The attributes of the two trigrams are: above, gentleness, forbearance toward inferiors; below, joyousness in obeying superiors. Such conditions create the basis of a mutual confidence that makes achievements possible. The character of fu ("truth") is actually the picture of a bird's foot over a fledgling. It suggests the idea of brooding. An egg is hollow. The light-giving power must work to quicken it from outside, but there must be a germ of life within, if life is to be awakened. Far-reaching speculations can be linked with these ideas.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE JUDGMENT                </h4>                <p data-book="jt" class='i pl5 mb--'>                    INNER TRUTH.

The force of inner truth must grow great indeed before its influence can extend to such creatures. In dealing with persons as intractable and as difficult to influence as a pig or a fish, the whole secret of success depends on finding the right way of approach. One must first rid oneself of all prejudice and, so to speak, let the psyche of the other person act on one without restraint. Then one will establish contact with him, understand and gain power over him. When a door has thus been opened, the force of one's personality will influence him. If in this way one finds no obstacles insurmountable, one can undertake even the most dangerous things, such as crossing the great water, and succeed. But it is important to understand upon what the force inner truth depends. This force is not identical with simple intimacy or a secret bond. Close ties may exist also among thieves; it is true that such a bond acts as a force but, since it is not invincible, it does not bring good fortune. All association on the basis of common interests holds only up to a certain point. Where the community of interest ceases, the holding together ceases also, and the closest friendship often changes into hate. Only when the bond is based on what is right, on steadfastness, will it remain so firm that it triumphs over everything.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Wind over lake: the image of INNER TRUTH.<br>                    Thus the superior man discusses criminal cases <br>                    In order to delay executions.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    Wind stirs water by penetrating it. Thus the superior man, when obliged to judge the mistakes of men, tries to penetrate their minds with understanding, in order to gain a sympathetic appreciation of the circumstances. In ancient China, the entire administration of justice was guided by this principle. A deep understanding that knows how to pardon was considered the highest form of justice. This system was not without success, for its aim was to make so strong a moral impression that there was no reason to fear abuse of such mildness. For it sprang not from weakness but from a superior clarity.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES                </h4>                <div data-line="61.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Being prepared brings good fortune.<br>                        If there are secret designs, it is disquieting.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        The force of inner truth depends chiefly on inner stability and preparedness.

The crane need not show itself on a high hill. It may be quite hidden when it sounds its call; yet its young will hear its not, will recognize it and give answer. Where there is a joyous mood, there a comrade will appear to share a glass of wine. This is the echo awakened in men through spiritual attraction. Whenever a feeling is voiced with truth and frankness, whenever a deed is the clear expression of sentiment, a mysterious and far-reaching influence is exerted. At first it acts on those who are inwardly receptive. But the circle grows larger and larger. The root of all influence lies in one's own inner being: given true and vigorous expression in word and deed, its effect is great. The effect is but the reflection of something that emanates from one's own heart. Any deliberate intention of an effect would only destroy the possibility of producing it. Confucius says about this line: <blockquote>The superior man abides in his room. If his words are well spoken, he meets with assent at a distance of more than a thousand miles. How much more then from near by! If the superior man abides in his room and his words are not well spoken, he meets with contradiction at a distance of more than a thousand miles. How much more then from near by! Words go forth from one's own person and exert their influence on men. Deeds are born close at hand and become visible far away. Words and deeds are the hinge and bowspring of the superior man. As hinge and bowspring move, they bring honor or disgrace. Through words and deeds the superior man moves heaven and earth .

This indeed is the basis of the exceptional situation indicated by the hexagram. When strong lines are outside, we have the hexagram <a href="#27">I, PROVIDING NOURISHMENT 27</a>, or <a href="#61">Chung Fu, INNER TRUTH, 61</a>; neither represents and exceptional state. When strong elements within preponderate, they necessarily enforce their will. This creates struggle and exceptional conditions in general. But in the present hexagram it is the weak element that perforce must mediate with the outside world.

We must understand the demands of the time in order to find the necessary offset for its deficiencies and damages. In any event we must not count on great success, since the requisite strength is lacking. In this lies the importance of the message that one should not strive after lofty things but hold to lowly things. The structure of the hexagram gives rise to the idea that this message is brought by a bird. In <a href="#28">Ta Kuo, PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT 28</a>, the four strong, heavy lines within, supported only by two weak lines without, give the image of a sagging ridgepole. Here the supporting weak lines are both outside and preponderant; this gives the image of a soaring bird. But a bird should not try to surpass itself and fly into the sun; it should descend to the earth, where its nest is. In this way it gives the message conveyed by the hexagram.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE IMAGE                </h4>                <p data-book="it" class="i pl5 mb--">                    Thunder on the mountain:<br>                    The image of PREPONDERANCE OF THE SMALL.<br>                    Thus in his conduct the superior man gives preponderance to reverence.<br>                    In bereavement he gives preponderance to grief.<br>                    In his expenditures he gives preponderance to thrift.                </p>                <p data-book="ic">                    Thunder on the mountain is different from thunder on the plain.

Thus the superior man derives an imperative from this image: he must always fix his eyes more closely and more directly on duty than does the ordinary man, even though this might make his behavior seem petty to the outside world. He is exceptionally conscientious in his actions. In bereavement emotion means more to him than ceremoniousness. In all his personal expenditures he is extremely simple and unpretentious. In comparison with the man of the masses, all this makes him stand out as exceptional. But the essential significance of his attitude lies in the fact that in external matters he is on the side of the lowly.                </p>                <h4 class="pl5 mt--">                    THE LINES                </h4>                <div data-line="62.1" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six at the beginning means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        The bird meets with misfortune through flying.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        A bird ought to remain in the nest until it is fledged.

In the temple of ancestors, where alternation of generations prevails, the grandson stands on the same side as the grandfather. Hence his closest relations are with the grandfather. The present line designates the grandson's wife, who during the sacrifice passes by the ancestor and goes toward the ancestress. This unusual behavior is, however, an expression of her modesty. She ventures rather to approach the ancestress, for she feels related to her by their common sex. Hence here deviation from the rule is not a mistake. Another image is that of the official who, in compliance with regulation, first seeks an audience with his prince. If he is not successful in this, he does not try to force anything but goes about conscientious fulfillment of his duty, taking his place among the other officials. This extraordinary restraint is likewise not a mistake in exceptional times. (The rule is that every official should first have an audience with the prince by whom he is appointed. Here the appointment is made by the minister.)                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="62.3" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine in the third place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        If one is not extremely careful,<br>                        Somebody may come up from behind and strike him.<br>                        Misfortune.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        At certain times extraordinary caution is absolutely necessary.

These elements here brought in to relation and thus generating energy are by nature hostile to each other. Only the most extreme caution can prevent damage. In life too there are junctures when all forces are in balance and work in harmony, so that everything seems to be in the best of order.

Applied to public life, this means that a man who wants to achieve something is not receiving that confidence of the authorities which he needs, so to speak, for his personal protection. Especially in times "after completion" it may happen that those who have come to power grow arrogant and conceited and no longer trouble themselves about fostering new talent. This as a rule results in office seeking. If a man's superiors withhold their trust from him, he will seek ways and means of getting it and of drawing attention to himself. We are warned against such an unworthy procedure: "Do not seek it." Do not throw yourself away on the world, but wait tranquilly and develop your personal worth by your own efforts. Times change. When the six stages of the hexagram have passed, the new era dawns. That which is a man's own cannot be permanently lost. It comes to him of its own accord.

After putting his realm in order with a strong hand, he waged long colonial wars for the subjection of the Huns who occupied the northern borderland with constant threat of incursions. The situation described is as follows. After times of completion, when a new power has arisen and everything within the country has been set in order, a period of colonial expansion almost inevitably follows. Then as a rule long-drawn-out struggles must be reckoned with. For this reason, a correct colonial policy is especially important. The territory won at such bitter cost must not be regarded as an almshouse for people who in one way or another have hade themselves impossible at home, but who are thought to be quite good enough for the colonies. Such a policy ruins at the outset any chance of success. This holds true in small as well as large matters, because it is not only rising states that carry on a colonial policy; the urge to expand, with its accompanying dangers, is part and parcel of every ambitious undertaking.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="63.4" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six in the fourth place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        The finest clothes turn to rags.<br>                        Be careful all day long.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        In a time of flowering culture, an occasional convulsion is bound to occur, uncovering a hidden evil within society and at first causing a great sensation.

If he remains strong and steadfast in his resolve, all goes well in the end.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="64.3" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six in the third place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Before completion, attack brings misfortune.<br>                        It furthers one to cross the great water.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        The time of transition has arrived, but one lacks the strength to complete the transition. If one should attempt to force it, disaster would result, because collapse would then be unavoidable. What is to be done? A new situation must be created; one must engage the energies of able helpers and in this fellowship take the decisive step-cross the great water. Then completion will become possible.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="64.4" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Nine in the fourth place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>                        Remorse disappears.<br>                        Shock, thus to discipline the Devil's Country.<br>                        For three years, great realms are rewarded.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        Now it is the time of struggle.

It is a question of a fierce battle to break and to discipline the Devil's Country, the forces of decadence. But the struggle also has its reward. Now is the time to lay the foundations of power and mastery for the future.                    </p>                </div>                <div data-line="64.5" class="hex-line">                    <p class="line-head">                        Six in the fifth place means:                    </p>                    <p class="line-text">                        Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>                        No remorse.<br>                        The light of the superior man is true.<br>                        Good fortune.                    </p>                    <p class="line-comm">                        The victory has been won.
